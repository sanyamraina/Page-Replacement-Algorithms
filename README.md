# Page-Replacement-Algorithms

TECH STACK :
1. ATOM EDITOR - BOOTSTRAP, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY , GOOGLE CHARTS
2. GITHUB - HOSTING WEBSITE - https://ablaze-ray.github.io/Page-Replacement-Algorithms/

NOTE : 1. REQUIRES JAVASCRIPT SETTINGS ON IN THE BROWSER.
       2. DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PLATFORM DEPENDENCY OR BACKEND INSTALLATION.(ALL THE LIBRARIES IMPORTED IN THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH LINKS , HENCE NO INSTALLATION IS REQUIRED) 	

RUNNING THE PROJECT:
1. OPEN THE ABLAZE-RAY FOLDER , OPEN THE index.html WHICH IS THE HOMEPAGE OF THE WEBSITE .
2. THE SCREEN WILL NOW SHOW THE HOMEPAGE, WITH A TITLE , NAVIGATION BAR , SOME INFORMATION AND ALGORITHMS WITH GRAPHS BUTTON.
3. TYPE IN THE NUMBER OF FRAMES , NUMBER OF PAGES , AND THE PAGE SEQUENCE AND SELECT THE ALGORITHM TO FIND ITS NUMBER OF PAGE HITS, NUMBER OF PAGE FAULTS AND HIT RATIO. THE ENTIRE PAGE ALLOCATION IN FRAMES(PAGE TABLE) IS DISPLAYED ALONGWITH THE ABOVE DETAILS.
4. TO COMPARE WITH OTHER ALGORITHMS , CLICK ANOTHER ALGORITHM AND THE OUTPUT IS GENERATED .
5. THE PROJECT SHOWCASES THE BELADY'S ANOMALY USING GRAPHS , HENCE ONCE THE STEP 3 IS COMPLETED , CLICK ON THE GRAPHS BUTTON TO OBSERVE THE GRAPH OF A PARTICULAR ALGORITHM. 
6. FOR A REFERENCE GUIDE ON THE ALGORITHMS AND BELADY'S PHENOMENON , VISIT THE MORE INFORMATION(WHICH IS THE info.html FILE IN THE ABLAZE-RAY FOLDER) TAB IN THE NAVIGATION TAB .

FURTHER RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION:
1. AN ANIMATION SHOWING THE PAGE ALLOCATION PORTRAYING A PAGE ENTRY, PAGE FAULT AND PAGE HIT OCCURENCE CAN BE INTEGRATED.
2. A INFERENCE CAN BE CONCLUDED ON WHICH ALGORITHM IS THE BEST FOR A  PARTICULAR NUMBER OF FRAMES AND PAGE SEQUENCE AFTER COMPARING THE MINIMUM PAGE FAULTS FOR A PAGE SEQUENCE.
